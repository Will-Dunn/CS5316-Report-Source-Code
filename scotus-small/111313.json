Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 385, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982), we held that the timely filing of an employment discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against a private employer.  The time limit on the filing of a charge is therefore subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.  In so holding, we settled a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.

The Commission denied relief, and petitioner then filed suit in Federal District Court.  Under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c), the complaint was due within 30 days of petitioner's receipt of notice of the EEOC's final action.  The District Court determined that petitioner had missed this deadline and dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 12(b)(1).  The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that \"the time limits for filing Title VII actions against the federal government are jurisdictional.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2.  The court relied on <i>Sims v. Heckler,</i> 725 F.2d 1143 (CA7 1984), which held that a federal employee's failure to file a timely administrative charge barred a later suit.  <i>Sims</i> concluded that considerations of sovereign immunity made the principles underlying <i>Zipes</i> inapplicable when the defendant is the Federal Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The position of the Seventh Circuit directly conflicts with that of three other Courts of Appeals.

Lehman,</i> 217 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 672 F.2d 207 (1982) (time limit for filing with EEOC).  The Ninth Circuit might be added to this list, though its position is unclear.  See <i>Cooper v.
