However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would nevertheless grant certiorari because petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel required that he be given access to his trial counsel's work files for use in his state habeas corpus hearing in which he alleged that trial counsel's representation was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death after a jury trial.  The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal.  443 So.2d 967 (1983). Following the issuance of a death warrant, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in state court.

The court rejected this argument with no substantive discussion, holding simply that \"the hearing on the motion comported with due process principles.\"  490 So.2d, at 932.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An essential element of our society's protection of citizens accused of crime is the right to effective assistance of counsel. <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984);  <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).  \"Counsel is provided to assist the defendant in presenting his defense, but in order to do so effectively the attorney must work closely with the defendant in formulating defense strategy. . . .  Moreover, counsel is likely to have to make a number of crucial decisions throughout the proceedings on a range of subjects that may require consultation with the defendant.  These decisons can best be made, and counel's duties most effectively discharged, if the attorney and the defendant have a relationship characterized by trust and confidence.\" <i>Morris v. Slappy,</i> 461 U.S. 1, 21, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1621, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in the result). Counsel's duty to maintain this trust and confidence extends beyond the trial itself.  Though he may not continue to represent the defendant following conviction and the disposition of post-trial motions, he must nevertheless cooperate with defendant's attempts to challenge the conviction or sentence, especially if he possesses unique information about a claim the defendant seeks to raise. Use of this informaton may be the decisive factor in determining the defendant's failure or success ondirect or collateral review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant's interest in the information in his trial counsel's exclusive possession is of even greater significance when the defendant alleges ineffective assistance by trial counsel.  Providing access to such information unquestionably advances the inquiry this Court identified in <i>Strickland v. Washington, supra,</i> 466 U.S., at 689, 104 S.Ct., at 2065-66, as essential to determining whether counsel has rendered ineffective assistance:  \"A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\"  There is no more accurate or reliable evidence of trial counsel's actual perspective and the extent of preparation undertaken than the contents of his client's case file.  Access to these materials is critical where, as here, trial counsel's testimony rests on little more than vague recollections. Indeed, with respect to petitioner's allegations that his trial attorney did not adequately prepare for the sentencing proceeding, petitioner's need for access to the work files is of paramount importance.  Denying access to what may be the most relevant evidence of the adequacy of legal representation is, in this respect, \"fundamentally incompatible with the Eighth Amendment's heightened 'need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment. . . .' \"  <i>Caldwell v.

Zant,</i> 683 F.2d 881, 885 (CA5 Unit B 1982)(interpreting Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3)).  The attorney's asserted need to ensure that he is \"free to express himself\" within the confines of a written file is likewise without merit. He seems to claim that if his recorded thoughts are not protected from discovery, he will be less likely to inform himself and consider along with his client the various defensive strategies that might be available.  In other words, he argues that he will be less likely to provide effective assistance of counsel, and yet this is precisely the issue petitioner wishes to investigate.  I cannot accept that a lawyer should oppose the disclosure of recorded thoughts that do not evidence ineffective assistance; nor can I accept that petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights do not prevail over his lawyer's asserted privacy interests where that lawyer's recorded thoughts may reflect that ineffective assistance has in fact been rendered.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Though states are not constitutionally required to establish avenues for seeking post-conviction relief from an erroneous conviction, \"when a State opts to act in a field where its action has significant discretionary elements, it must nonetheless act in accord with the dictates of the Constitution and, in particular, in accord with the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Evitts v.

Moreover, counsel is likely to have to make a number of crucial decisions throughout the proceedings on a range of subjects that may require consultation with the defendant.

Though he may not continue to represent the defendant following conviction and the disposition of post-trial motions, he must nevertheless cooperate with defendant's attempts to challenge the conviction or sentence, especially if he possesses unique information about a claim the defendant seeks to raise.

Providing access to such information unquestionably advances the inquiry this Court identified in <i>Strickland v. Washington, supra,</i> 466 U.S., at 689, 104 S.Ct., at 2065-66, as essential to determining whether counsel has rendered ineffective assistance:  \"A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\"  There is no more accurate or reliable evidence of trial counsel's actual perspective and the extent of preparation undertaken than the contents of his client's case file.  Access to these materials is critical where, as here, trial counsel's testimony rests on little more than vague recollections. Indeed, with respect to petitioner's allegations that his trial attorney did not adequately prepare for the sentencing proceeding, petitioner's need for access to the work files is of paramount importance.  Denying access to what may be the most relevant evidence of the adequacy of legal representation is, in this respect, \"fundamentally incompatible with the Eighth Amendment's heightened 'need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment. . . .' \"  <i>Caldwell v.

The attorney's asserted need to ensure that he is \"free to express himself\" within the confines of a written file is likewise without merit. He seems to claim that if his recorded thoughts are not protected from discovery, he will be less likely to inform himself and consider along with his client the various defensive strategies that might be available.  In other words, he argues that he will be less likely to provide effective assistance of counsel, and yet this is precisely the issue petitioner wishes to investigate.
