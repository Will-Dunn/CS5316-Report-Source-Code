The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and reinstated the jury verdict in favor of respondents.  734 F.2d 1336 (1984).

Anticompetitive forcing only exists if consumers are forced to buy a tied product as a result of the sellers' market power, not simply because of the desirability of the package.  <i>Id.,</i> at 24-25, 104 S.Ct. at 1564-1565.  The Court of Appeals looked to market power over \"locked in\" customers who had already purchased petitioner's wares, viewed the copyright on the operating system as creating a presumption of market power, and seemingly concluded that forcing power is sufficiently established to demonstrate <i>per se</i> antitrust liability if some buyers find the tying product unique and desirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing distinctions between the permissible and the forbidden in this area is difficult, and the posture of this case a jury verdict overturned by the District Court but reinstated on appeal&#8212;creates an additional layer of complexity, since each court below took a different view of what facts were relevant. Nonetheless, this case raises several substantial questions of antitrust law and policy, including what constitutes forcing power in the absence of a large share of the general market, whether market power over \"locked in\" customers must be analyzed at the outset of the original decision to purchase, and what effect should be given to the existence of a copyright or other legal monopoly in determining market power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At stake is more than the resolution of this single controversy or even the clarification of what may seem at times to be a collection of arcane legal distinctions.
