The petition for a writ of certiorari is\ndenied.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n  Respondent James Lawhorn was sentenced to death by\nan Alabama court in 1989. Nearly two decades later, the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\ngranted him habeas relief on the ground that his counsel\nhad rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencing\nhearing by failing to make a closing argument. In my\nview that decision was patently wrong: The court had no\nbasis in law for setting aside the state courts’ judgment\nthat respondent had failed to establish a probable effect of\nthat failure upon the outcome. I dissent from the Court’s\ndecision not to grant certiorari and summarily reverse the\nEleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n                               I\n    In March 1988, Altion Maxine Walker offered to pay her\nnephews, James Lawhorn and his brother Mac Lawhorn,\n$100 in exchange for murdering her boyfriend, William\nBerry. The Lawhorns accepted. After they ambushed\nBerry, Mac Lawhorn shot him, causing him to fall. James\nLawhorn (hereinafter Lawhorn) then heard Berry making\n“ ‘gurgling noises’ ” and shot him repeatedly “ ‘to make sure\nhe was dead.’ ” 519 F. 3d 1272, 1278 (CA11 2008).\n\f2                   ALLEN v. LAWHORN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Lawhorn was arrested for the crime and made a full\nconfession. An Alabama jury found him guilty of capital\nmurder. During the sentencing phase, Lawhorn’s lawyer\ngave an opening argument, detailing the mitigating fac\ntors that would be established by the forthcoming testi\nmony. Lawhorn’s mother, sister, junior high school prin\ncipal, and juvenile probation officer then testified on the\ndefendant’s behalf. Lawhorn himself also gave a brief\nstatement to the jury, saying that he knew his actions\nwere wrong and asking them to “ ‘please have mercy on\nme.’ ” Id., at 1280. At the close of the testimony, Law\nhorn’s counsel waived his right to closing argument; his\nensuing objection to the prosecutor’s making closing ar\ngument was overruled.\n   The jury made a recommendation of death, which the\ntrial judge accepted. The Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed the\nconviction and sentence. See Lawhorn v. State, 581 So. 2d\n1159 (1990); Ex parte Lawhorn, 581 So. 2d 1179 (1991).\nWe denied Lawhorn’s petition for certiorari. 502 U. S. 970\n(1991).\n   Lawhorn moved in state court for postconviction relief.\nHe contended, as relevant here, that his lawyer’s failure to\ngive a closing argument in the sentencing phase consti\ntuted ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The trial court—the\nsame court that had imposed the death sentence—denied\nthe motion, on dual grounds that counsel’s waiver of clos\ning argument was a reasonable strategic decision, and\nthat Lawhorn had failed to establish prejudice from the\nwaiver. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,\nLawhorn v. State, 756 So. 2d 971 (1999). The Supreme\nCourt of Alabama denied certiorari, No. 1982018 (Jan. 7,\n2000), as did we, 531 U. S. 835 (2000).\n   Lawhorn then sought federal habeas relief. The District\nCourt set aside both the conviction and the sentence.\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nLawhorn v. Haley, 323 F. Supp. 2d 1158 (ND Ala. 2004).\nA panel of the Eleventh Circuit reversed with regard to\nthe conviction, but affirmed with regard to the sentence.\n519 F. 3d 1272. With regard to the latter, it sustained the\nDistrict Court’s finding that counsel’s failure to give a\nclosing argument was not a reasonable strategic decision,\nbut rested on the erroneous belief that that would pre\nclude closing argument by the prosecutor; and it sustained\nthe District Court’s conclusion that Lawhorn had been\nprejudiced by counsel’s failure. The Eleventh Circuit\ndenied the State’s petitions for panel rehearing, No. 04–\n11711 (Mar. 31, 2010) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n197a, and rehearing en banc, No. 04–11711 (Mar. 29,\n2010), App. to Pet. for Cert. 220a–221a—after, I may note,\nan unexplained delay of over two years.\n  The State now petitions for certiorari. It does not chal\nlenge the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion that counsel’s\nperformance was deficient; it contends only that it was\nerror to find that Lawhorn had established prejudice.\n                          II\n  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) provides in part as follows:\n    “An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\n    . . . resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in\n    volved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\n  The State contends that the Eleventh Circuit errone\nously considered the claim of prejudice de novo, rather\nthan granting the deference mandated by AEDPA to the\n\f4                   ALLEN v. LAWHORN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstate court’s conclusion. Lawhorn does not deny that the\nEleventh Circuit was required to grant deference, but\ncontends that it did so. He acknowledges that in its dis\ncussion of the prejudice claim the Court of Appeals did not\nso much as cite AEDPA, but argues that “[t]his Court has\nnever required any magical incantation of the terms of\n§2254(d)(1) in habeas corpus appeals” and that “[i]t is\nunreasonable as a matter of law to suggest that [the Elev\nenth] Circuit . . . is unfamiliar with or did not apply\n§2254(d).” Brief in Opposition 25–26.\n   If indeed Lawhorn is correct that the Eleventh Circuit\nattempted to apply §2254(d), it is clear that the attempt\nfailed. As we have repeatedly explained, AEDPA imposes\na “highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court\nrulings, and demands that state-court decisions be given\nthe benefit of the doubt.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 5) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted); accord, Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10–11); Schriro v. Landrigan,\n550 U. S. 465, 473 (2007); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S.\n19, 24–25 (2002) (per curiam); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 410–411 (2000). The doubt of which the Ala\nbama Court of Criminal Appeals was to be given the bene\nfit was particularly expansive in this case, since none of\nour cases has ever considered whether the failure to give a\nclosing argument can be considered prejudicial under\nStrickland. Accordingly, only the standard for ineffective\nassistance set forth in Strickland itself could be applied;\nand as we have explained, “because the Strickland stan\ndard is a general standard, a state court has even more\nlatitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not\nsatisfied that standard.” Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11). “[T]he more general the rule at issue—and thus\nthe greater the potential for reasoned disagreement\namong fair-minded judges—the more leeway state courts\nhave in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determina\n\f                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntions.” Renico, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8–9) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   Strickland requires the defendant to show that there is\na “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofes\nsional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” 466 U. S., at 694. The trial judge, who wit\nnessed the proceedings and imposed Lawhorn’s death\nsentence, concluded that Lawhorn had not made that\nshowing. He explained that “[t]rial counsel did not pre\nsent a complicated case in mitigation that needed to be\nexplained to the jury”; that counsel had “presented Law\nhorn’s family background and pleas for mercy in mitiga\ntion,” making closing argument on those matters unneces\nsary; and that “this was a horrible crime and the jury\nwould not have been swayed by a closing argument con\nsidering the facts of this case.” 756 So. 2d, at 987 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Alabama Court of Crimi\nnal Appeals quoted those findings and agreed that “in this\nsituation with these particular facts, closing argument by\ndefense counsel would have had little impact.” Ibid.\n   This was not an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nCounsel’s closing statement is rhetorical argument, not\nevidence. Reconstructing what that argument might have\nbeen, and how the jury might have reacted to it—a jury\nthat had already heard opening argument and a proces\nsion of mitigation witnesses—is an exercise in guesswork.\nThe Eleventh Circuit’s reasons for finding prejudice are\nunpersuasive.\n   The Eleventh Circuit observed that one juror had voted\nto recommend life; and because a vote of 10 to 2 was re\nquired to recommend a death sentence, counsel “needed\nonly to convince two other jurors to alter the outcome of\nthe proceedings.” 519 F. 3d, at 1297. (Apart from the fact\nthat the jury’s recommendation is in any event not binding\non the sentencing judge, a 9–to–3 vote would not have\nproduced recommendation of a life sentence, but would\n\f6                   ALLEN v. LAWHORN\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhave resulted in a mistrial and empanelling of a new\nsentencing jury. See Ala. Code §§13A–5–46(f), (g), 13A–5–\n47(e) (2006).) But it cannot be deduced from the existence\nof a single dissenting juror that a closing argument would\nhave persuaded other jurors not to recommend a death\nsentence. That there was one juror against a recommen\ndation of death does not establish that this was a close\nmitigation case, much less that a closing argument would\nhave made the difference for other jurors.\n  The Eleventh Circuit provided several examples of\nstatements Lawhorn’s counsel could have made. Closing\nargument might “have refreshed the jury’s memory of the\nevidence of substantial domination presented during the\nguilt phase.” 519 F. 3d, at 1297. Counsel “could have . . .\nargued for the mitigation of Lawhorn’s age at the time of\nthe offense and his troubled family background,” and could\nhave asked the jury for mercy. Ibid. But merely identify\ning statements counsel could have made (there will always\nbe statements counsel could have made) does not establish\nwhat Strickland requires: that those statements would\nprobably have made a difference. All the facts relevant to\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s hypothesized closing argument had\nalready come out in the sentencing phase. And a plea for\nmercy had been made in the sentencing phase by Lawhorn\nhimself.\n  The hypothesized closing argument falls even further\nshort of establishing what AEDPA requires: that it was\nnot merely incorrect but unreasonable for the Alabama\ncourts to conclude that probability of a different outcome\nhad not been shown. It was, to the contrary, well within\nthe bounds of reasonable judgment for the Alabama Court\nof Criminal Appeals to conclude that “in this situation\nwith these particular facts, closing argument by defense\ncounsel would have had little impact.” 756 So. 2d, at 987.\n  In sum, the outcome imposed upon the Alabama courts\nby the Eleventh Circuit is not remotely required by clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                        *    *     *\n   It has been over 21 years since Lawhorn was sentenced\nto death. Alabama should be not barred from carrying out\nits judgment based on a federal court’s lawless specula\ntion. I would not dissent from denial of certiorari if what\nhappened here were an isolated judicial error. It is not.\nWith distressing frequency, especially in capital cases\nsuch as this, federal judges refuse to be governed by Con\ngress’s command that state criminal judgments must not\nbe revised by federal courts unless they are “contrary to,\nor involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) (emphasis\nadded). We invite continued lawlessness when we permit\na patently improper interference with state justice such as\nthat which occurred in this case to stand. We should\ngrant Alabama’s petition for certiorari and summarily\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n\f",

S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntions.” Renico, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8–9) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   Strickland requires the defendant to show that there is\na “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofes\nsional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” 466 U. S., at 694. The trial judge, who wit\nnessed the proceedings and imposed Lawhorn’s death\nsentence, concluded that Lawhorn had not made that\nshowing. He explained that “[t]rial counsel did not pre\nsent a complicated case in mitigation that needed to be\nexplained to the jury”; that counsel had “presented Law\nhorn’s family background and pleas for mercy in mitiga\ntion,” making closing argument on those matters unneces\nsary; and that “this was a horrible crime and the jury\nwould not have been swayed by a closing argument con\nsidering the facts of this case.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 987 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Alabama Court of Crimi\nnal Appeals quoted those findings and agreed that “in this\nsituation with these particular facts, closing argument by\ndefense counsel would have had little impact.” Ibid.\n   This was not an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nCounsel’s closing statement is rhetorical argument, not\nevidence. Reconstructing what that argument might have\nbeen, and how the jury might have reacted to it—a jury\nthat had already heard opening argument and a proces\nsion of mitigation witnesses—is an exercise in guesswork.\nThe Eleventh Circuit’s reasons for finding prejudice are\nunpersuasive.\n   The Eleventh Circuit observed that one juror had voted\nto recommend life; and because a vote of 10 to 2 was re\nquired to recommend a death sentence, counsel “needed\nonly to convince two other jurors to alter the outcome of\nthe proceedings.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1297. (Apart from the fact\nthat the jury’s recommendation is in any event not binding\non the sentencing judge, a 9–to–3 vote would not have\nproduced recommendation of a life sentence, but would\n\f6                   ALLEN v. LAWHORN\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhave resulted in a mistrial and empanelling of a new\nsentencing jury. See Ala. Code §§13A–5–46(f), (g), 13A–5–\n47(e) (2006).) But it cannot be deduced from the existence\nof a single dissenting juror that a closing argument would\nhave persuaded other jurors not to recommend a death\nsentence. That there was one juror against a recommen\ndation of death does not establish that this was a close\nmitigation case, much less that a closing argument would\nhave made the difference for other jurors.\n  The Eleventh Circuit provided several examples of\nstatements Lawhorn’s counsel could have made. Closing\nargument might “have refreshed the jury’s memory of the\nevidence of substantial domination presented during the\nguilt phase.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1297. Counsel “could have . . .\nargued for the mitigation of Lawhorn’s age at the time of\nthe offense and his troubled family background,” and could\nhave asked the jury for mercy. Ibid. But merely identify\ning statements counsel could have made (there will always\nbe statements counsel could have made) does not establish\nwhat Strickland requires: that those statements would\nprobably have made a difference. All the facts relevant to\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s hypothesized closing argument had\nalready come out in the sentencing phase. And a plea for\nmercy had been made in the sentencing phase by Lawhorn\nhimself.\n  The hypothesized closing argument falls even further\nshort of establishing what AEDPA requires: that it was\nnot merely incorrect but unreasonable for the Alabama\ncourts to conclude that probability of a different outcome\nhad not been shown. It was, to the contrary, well within\nthe bounds of reasonable judgment for the Alabama Court\nof Criminal Appeals to conclude that “in this situation\nwith these particular facts, closing argument by defense\ncounsel would have had little impact.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 987.\n  In sum, the outcome imposed upon the Alabama courts\nby the Eleventh Circuit is not remotely required by clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.\n\f                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                        *    *     *\n   It has been over 21 years since Lawhorn was sentenced\nto death. Alabama should be not barred from carrying out\nits judgment based on a federal court’s lawless specula\ntion. I would not dissent from denial of certiorari if what\nhappened here were an isolated judicial error. It is not.\nWith distressing frequency, especially in capital cases\nsuch as this, federal judges refuse to be governed by Con\ngress’s command that state criminal judgments must not\nbe revised by federal courts unless they are “contrary to,\nor involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §2254(d)(1) (emphasis\nadded). We invite continued lawlessness when we permit\na patently improper interference with state justice such as\nthat which occurred in this case to stand. We should\ngrant Alabama’s petition for certiorari and summarily\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n\f</pre>",
